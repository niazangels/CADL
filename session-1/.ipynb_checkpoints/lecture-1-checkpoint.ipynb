    "This course introduces you to deep learning: the state-of-the-art approach to building artificial intelligence algorithms.  We cover the basic components of deep learning, what it means, how it works, and develop code necessary to build various algorithms such as deep convolutional networks, variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and recurrent neural networks.  A major focus of this course will be to not only understand how to build the necessary components of these algorithms, but also how to apply them for exploring creative applications.  We'll see how to train a computer to recognize objects in an image and use this knowledge to drive new and interesting behaviors, from understanding the similarities and differences in large datasets and using them to self-organize, to understanding how to infinitely generate entirely new content or match the aesthetics or contents of another image.  Deep learning offers enormous potential for creative applications and in this course we interrogate what's possible.  Through practical applications and guided homework assignments, you'll be expected to create datasets, develop and train neural networks, explore your own media collections using existing state-of-the-art deep nets, synthesize new content from generative algorithms, and understand deep learning's potential for creating entirely new aesthetics and new ways of interacting with large amounts of data.​​\n",

    "Deep learning has emerged at the forefront of nearly every major computational breakthrough in the last 4 years.  It is no wonder that it is already in many of the products we use today, from netflix or amazon's personalized recommendations; to the filters that block our spam; to ways that we interact with personal assistants like Apple's Siri or Microsoft Cortana, even to the very ways our personal health is monitored.  And sure deep learning algorithms are capable of some amazing things.  But it's not just science applications that are benefiting from this research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Artists too are starting to explore how Deep Learning can be used in their own practice.  Photographers are starting to explore different ways of exploring visual media.  Generative artists are writing algorithms to create entirely new aesthetics. Filmmakers are exploring virtual worlds ripe with potential for procedural content.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we're going straight to the state of the art.  And we're going to learn it all.  We'll see how to make an algorithm paint an image, or hallucinate objects in a photograph.  We'll see how to train a computer to recognize objects in an image and use this knowledge to drive new and interesting behaviors, from understanding the similarities and differences in large datasets to using them to self organize, to understanding how to infinitely generate entirely new content or match the aesthetics or contents of other images.  We'll even see how to teach a computer to read and synthesize new phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we won't just be using other peoples code to do all of this.  We're going to develop everything ourselves using Tensorflow and I'm going to show you how to do it.  This course isn't just for artists nor is it just for programmers.  It's for people that want to learn more about how to apply deep learning with a hands on approach, straight into the python console, and learn what it all means through creative thinking and interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm Parag Mital, artist, researcher and Director of Machine Intelligence at Kadenze.  For the last 10 years, I've been exploring creative uses of computational models making use of machine and deep learning, film datasets, eye-tracking, EEG, and fMRI recordings exploring applications such as generative film experiences, augmented reality hallucinations, and expressive control of large audiovisual corpora.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this course isn't just about me.  It's about bringing all of you together.  It's about bringing together different backgrounds, different practices, and sticking all of you in the same virtual room, giving you access to state of the art methods in deep learning, some really amazing stuff, and then letting you go wild on the Kadenze platform.  We've been working very hard to build a platform for learning that rivals anything else out there for learning this stuff.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be able to share your content, upload videos, comment and exchange code and ideas, all led by the course I've developed for us.  But before we get there we're going to have to cover a lot of groundwork.  The basics that we'll use to develop state of the art algorithms in deep learning.  And that's really so we can better interrogate what's possible, ask the bigger questions, and be able to explore just where all this is heading in more depth.  With all of that in mind, Let's get started>\n",

    "We're first going to talk about Deep Learning, what it is, and how it relates to other branches of learning.  We'll then talk about the major components of Deep Learning, the importance of datasets, and the nature of representation, which is at the heart of deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've never used Python before, we'll be jumping straight into using libraries like numpy, matplotlib, and scipy. Before starting this session, please check the resources section for a notebook introducing some fundamentals of python programming.  When you feel comfortable with loading images from a directory, resizing, cropping, how to change an image datatype from unsigned int to float32, and what the range of each data type should be, then come back here and pick up where you left off.  We'll then get our hands dirty with Tensorflow, Google's library for machine intelligence.  We'll learn the basic components of creating a computational graph with Tensorflow, including how to convolve an image to detect interesting features at different scales.  This groundwork will finally lead us towards automatically learning our handcrafted features/algorithms.\n",

    "## Deep Learning vs. Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is this word I keep using, Deep Learning.  And how is it different to Machine Learning?  Well Deep Learning is a *type* of Machine Learning algorithm that uses Neural Networks to learn.  The type of learning is \"Deep\" because it is composed of many layers of Neural Networks.  In this course we're really going to focus on supervised and unsupervised Deep Learning.  But there are many other incredibly valuable branches of Machine Learning such as Reinforcement Learning, Dictionary Learning, Probabilistic Graphical Models and Bayesian Methods (Bishop), or Genetic and Evolutionary Algorithms.  And any of these branches could certainly even be combined with each other or with Deep Networks as well.  We won't really be able to get into these other branches of learning in this course.  Instead, we'll focus more on building \"networks\", short for neural networks, and how they can do some really amazing things.  Before we can get into all that, we're going to need to understand a bit more about data and its importance in deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"invariances\"></a>\n",
    "## Invariances\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning requires data.  A lot of it.  It's really one of the major reasons as to why Deep Learning has been so successful.  Having many examples of the thing we are trying to learn is the first thing you'll need before even thinking about Deep Learning.  Often, it is the biggest blocker to learning about something in the world.  Even as a child, we need a lot of experience with something before we begin to understand it.  I find I spend most of my time just finding the right data for a network to learn.  Getting it from various sources, making sure it all looks right and is labeled.  That is a lot of work.  The rest of it is easy as we'll see by the end of this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we would like build a network that is capable of looking at an image and saying what object is in the image.  There are so many possible ways that an object could be manifested in an image.  It's rare to ever see just a single object in isolation. In order to teach a computer about an object, we would have to be able to give it an image of an object in every possible way that it could exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "We generally call these ways of existing \"invariances\".  That just means we are trying not to vary based on some factor.  We are invariant to it.  For instance, an object could appear to one side of an image, or another.  We call that translation invariance.  Or it could be from one angle or another.  That's called rotation invariance.  Or it could be closer to the camera, or farther.  and That would be scale invariance.  There are plenty of other types of invariances, such as perspective or brightness or exposure to give a few more examples for photographic images.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"scope-of-learning\"></a>\n",
    "## Scope of Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "With Deep Learning, you will always need a dataset that will teach the algorithm about the world.  But you aren't really teaching it everything.  You are only teaching it what is in your dataset!  That is a very important distinction.  If I show my algorithm only faces of people which are always placed in the center of an image, it will not be able to understand anything about faces that are not in the center of the image!  Well at least that's mostly true.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's not to say that a network is incapable of transfering what it has learned to learn new concepts more easily.  Or to learn things that might be necessary for it to learn other representations.  For instance, a network that has been trained to learn about birds, probably knows a good bit about trees, branches, and other bird-like hangouts, depending on the dataset.  But, in general, we are limited to learning what our dataset has access to.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you're thinking about creating a dataset, you're going to have to think about what it is that you want to teach your network.  What sort of images will it see?  What representations do you think your network could learn given the data you've shown it?\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the major contributions to the success of Deep Learning algorithms is the amount of data out there.  Datasets have grown from orders of hundreds to thousands to many millions.   The more data you have, the more capable your network will be at determining whatever its objective is.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"existing-datasets\"></a>\n",
    "## Existing datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind, let's try to find a dataset that we can work with.  There are a ton of datasets out there that current machine learning researchers use.  For instance if I do a quick Google search for Deep Learning Datasets, i can see for instance a link on deeplearning.net, listing a few interesting ones e.g. http://deeplearning.net/datasets/, including MNIST, CalTech, CelebNet, LFW, CIFAR, MS Coco, Illustration2Vec, and there are ton more.  And these are primarily image based.  But if you are interested in finding more, just do a quick search or drop a quick message on the forums if you're looking for something in particular.\n",
